## Description

This tool helps keep track of Abyssal runs in Eve Online, so you can focus on DOING runs instead of tracking them. It saves all the information you need for later use, and lets you run abyssals many times in a row without distractions. After you're done, all the information is conveniently stored, can be copied to clipboard and easily inserted into Abyssal Tracker or any other tracking tool you use.
